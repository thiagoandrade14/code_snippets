## Description ##
(The purpose of this repository is to provide sample code of past projects.)
This repository contain code snippets of very small projects I have worked on in my classes and that would deserve their own repo.

## Functionality ##
Each file has its own independent functionality.
bst.h implements a templated binary search tree and its essential function prototypes. (code written in C++, Summer 2019)

deque.h implements a deque data structure and its prototypes. (written with C++, Summer 2019)

threading.cpp demonstrates the threading functionality in Linux systems by taking an integer as input and then assigning multiple threads to an artificial "task" of generating random numbers until it finds the key. (C++, Spring 2020)
